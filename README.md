Simple biotope simulator to write AI for characters
========================

This simple project is to be used for teaching an aritifial intelligence lecture.

Most of the AI stuff goes to model::perform_step(), the basic idea is that you need to know little else.


Building
========

We need C++11 compiler. Not a problem with Windows, on Linux/Mac we need a really new version of gcc, e.g., 4.6.3. The better alternative is clang. It is automatically included with XCode or development tools on a Mac and is of a fresh enough version 3.2. Under Linux use your repository system to install clang++, e.g., `apt-get install clang` under Debian and Ubuntu.

You can use the provided Makefile.gcc and Makefile.clang files. The first was tested under Ubuntu, the latter under Mac OS X.

Further depencency is wxwidgets toolkit. Use your repository system or `brew` to install it on Linux/Mac. (On Linux you need to install libwxgtkk2.8-dev; merely installing `libwx*-header` and its dependencies does not help in Ubuntu Linux.) Download it and build it yourself under Windows, the URL is http://www.wxwidgets.org/. For building under Windows utilise the provided VisualStudio solution file.
